Functionality:
1) vx_cl_warpSpawn()
   -> To be used by pocl->ops->run

2) newlib Integration (LoadFile(""))
   -> To be used by the Rhinio benchmarks

3) POCL OPS Vortex Suite

Performance:
1) Icache doesn't need SEND_MEM_REQUEST Stage
   -> Blocks are never dirty, so why not evict right away 

2) Branch not taken speculation

3) Runtime -02 not running on RTL, and -03 not running on RTL and Emulator


Vector:
1) Cycle accurate simulator (would require Cache Simulator)
